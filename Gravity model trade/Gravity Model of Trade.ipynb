    "# Gravity Model of Trade \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a demonstration for LSE undergraduate economics students for a python weekend. Created for teaching purposes only. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is baseed on ESCAP work available in Stata and R, which can be found [here.](\"https://www.unescap.org/resources/gravity-model-international-trade-user-guide-r-version\")\n",

    "The gravity model was initially presented as an intuitive way of understanding trade flows. \n",

    "# The basic gravity model \n",
    "In its most basic form, the gravity model can be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"simple gravity equation.png\" alt=\"simple gravity equation.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tij is the Flow of goods from country i to country j.\n",
    "* Yi and Yj are the sizes (or “masses”) of economies i and j.\n",
    "* Dij is the distance between i and j.\n",
    "* G represents “everything else”; call it the “gravitational constant.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What does the model show? \n",
    "The name “gravity” comes from the fact that the nonlinear form of equation (1a) resembles Newton’s law of gravity: exports are directly proportional to the exporting and importing countries’ economic “mass” (GDP), and inversely\n",
    "proportional to the distance between them (not the square of the distance between them, as in\n",
    "physics). \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, gravity says: \n",
    "1. We expect larger country pairs to trade more, but \n",
    "2. We expect countries that are further apart to trade less (perhaps because transport costs between them are higher).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real world applicability \n",
    "\n",
    "* Does this have a basis in real life? \n",
    "* Does trade depend on distance? \n",
    "* How might this be used when discussing new trade deals in light of Brexit? - is the EU the UK's biggest trading partner? \n",

    "# 1. Import packages\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to import the following packages: \n",
    "* pandas\n",
    "* numpy \n",
    "* matplotlib \n",
    "* statsmodels \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Import the data\n",
    "Before you import the data, you need to dowload the dataset and save it to your directory. \n",
    "We will be using two datasets: \n",
    "1. Gravity model services data\n",
    "2. ONS trade data\n",

    "* The gravity model is no longer concerned only with trade in goods, but has recently been applied with success to trade in services (e.g., Kimura and Lee, 2006). \n",
    "\n",
    "* This tutorial will concentrate on the emerging area of trade in services, where increased data availability is making it increasingly feasible to apply the most up-to-date estimation methods and models. \n",

    "# 3. Inspect the data \n",

    "### Student guidance: \n",
    "Here are some tips for what you should look for \n",
    "1. Use 'info' function \n",
    "2. Shape of the data \n",
    "3. Check for any null values (NA) \n",
    "4. Count the number of unique 'exp' i.e. export countries there are\n",
    "5. Identify the unique Sectors \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Check for correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "A first step in examining the intuition behind the gravity model is to examine the correlations among\n",
    "the variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, we first put the data in the correct format. \n",
    "1. We select the variables for which we are interested in calculating the correlation. In this case, these are: trade, distance, GDP of export country and GDP of import country.\n",
    "2. Afterwards we make sure no zero and missing values are included.  \n",
    "3. Convert our relevant columns into logs (You should look for the documentation of 'np.log')\n",
    "4. Create a scatter diagram for log GDP combined and log trade \n",
    "5. Create a scatter diagram for log distance combined and log trade \n",
    "6. Re-create these scatter diagrams with corr and add a line of best fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For line of best fit recall the simple equation is y=mx+b\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a relationship? Does it make sense? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problems with the intuitive gravity model \n",
    "\n",
    "The previous section shows that the basic gravity model picks up two important stylized facts of\n",
    "international trade: \n",
    "1. Bigger countries trade more, and \n",
    "2. More distant countries trade less. \n",
    "\n",
    "These regularities are almost uniformly reflected in the early gravity literature, which applies the model to all regions of the world, covering both developed and developing economies, and various products and\n",
    "time periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is clearly a useful starting point in applied international trade research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other issues to consider: \n",
    "* The data show a regular pattern: after taking into account partner size, trade is inversely proportionate to geographic distance.\n",
    "* “Cultural distance” also matters: language, colonial history, legal sys.\n",
    "* However, for a given distance, crossing national borders is a large impediment to trade\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Estimating the gravity model \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have looked at what relationship might exist, we can now attempt to estimate the gravity model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use the 'intuitive gravity model' we've been working with thus far, and discusses estimation via ordinary least squares and interpretation of results. \n",
    "\n",
    "At its most basic, the intuitive gravity model takes the following log-linearized form:\n",
    "(1a) log𝑋𝑖𝑗 = 𝑐 + 𝑏1 log 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑖 + 𝑏2 log 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑗 + 𝑏3 log 𝜏𝑖𝑗 + 𝑒𝑖𝑗\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(1𝑏) log 𝜏𝑖𝑗 = log(𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑗)\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "* 𝑋𝑖𝑗 indicates exports from country i to country j, \n",
    "* GDP is each country’s gross domestic product,\n",
    "* 𝜏𝑖𝑗 represents trade costs between the two countries, \n",
    "* _distance_ is the geographical distance between them—as an observable proxy for trade costs—and \n",
    "* 𝑒𝑖𝑗 is a random error term. \n",
    "* c is a regression constant, and \n",
    "* b terms are coefficients to be estimated. \n",
    "\n",
    "where eij has been added as a random disturbance term (error). \n",
    "\n",
    "As an econometric problem, the objective is to obtain estimates of the unknown b parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Student guidance \n",
    "At this point is is helpful to remind your group what the conditions are for the OLS estimation to be considered BLUE.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Begin by only estimating using combined GDP and distance.\n",
    "2. Then control for other variables\n",
    "3. Re-run the regression ensuring robust standard errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure the dimensions of the variables are correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Extension: Brexit \n",
    "Next we think about the real-world implications of the gravity model, despite its drawbacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The UK is going to spend 2020 and beyond negotiating new trade deals after it left the European Union in January 2020. Will the issues of size and distance be an issue for the UK? \n",
    "\n",
    "Import the ONS data and assess the following: \n",
    "1. The UK's top 5 largest trading partners to EXPORT\n",
    "2. The UK's bottom 5 trading partners to EXPORT \n",
    "3. Within the top 5, back continent do these countries below to? What proportion do they make of trade partnerships \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this imply about future trade negotiations and what might this imply about countries that import into the UK? \n"
