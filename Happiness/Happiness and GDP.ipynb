    "You are an economist at HM Treasury. Your team have recently heard the New Zealand government have extended their dashboard on wellbeing indicators. You are asked to look at what evidence there is to consider happiness and other wellbeing indicators when measuring the economy. What relevance, if any, does this have to the UK?"

    "# Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2019 the New Zealand government published their new 'Wellbeing Budget. This was an attempt to include a broad set of indicators such as mental health, child poverty and domestic violence to have a forward looking approach to the environment, the strength of communities and the performance of the economy. \n",

    "#### The Stiglitz Commission \n",
    "The 2009 Stiglitz Commission stated that “Research has shown that it is possible to collect meaningful and reliable data on subjective as well as objective well-being. Subjective well-being encompasses different aspects (cognitive evaluations of one’s life, happiness, satisfaction, positive emotions such as joy and pride, and negative emotions such as pain and worry): each of them should be measured separately to derive a more comprehensive appreciation of people’s lives... [SWB] should be included in larger-scale surveys undertaken by official statistical offices”.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subjective Wellbeing \n",
    "Subjective Wellbeing is measured by simply asking people about their happiness. SWB is beginning to be used to monitor progress and to inform policy in terms of depression rates and in the provision of cognitive behavioural therapy. Policy appraisal using SWB has interested academics for decades and is increasinly concerning policymakers.\n",
